This Pac-Man program in C demonstrates the following key programming concepts:

Control Structures: Loops and conditionals manage game flow, such as movement and collision detection.
Functions: Modular design with functions for initialization, drawing the board, handling movement, and managing game state.
File Handling: High scores and game logs are saved and loaded using file I/O.
Global Variables: Used to maintain game state like the score, Pac-Man's position, and the board layout.
User Input: Real-time input (getch()) for player controls.
